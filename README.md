---

# 🚀 6️⃣ Performance Optimization

### 🔹 Memoization Concept
- Why memoization is needed

### 🔹 React.memo
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Shallow comparison

### 🔹 useMemo
- Memoize values
- Avoid expensive recalculations

### 🔹 useCallback
- Memoize functions
- Prevent child re-renders

### 🔹 When NOT to use memoization

---

# 🔥 7️⃣ Advanced React Hooks

- 🔹 forwardRef
- 🔹 useDeferredValue
- 🔹 useTransition
- 🔹 flushSync
- 🔹 createPortal
- 🔹 useLayoutEffect
- 🔹 useDebugValue

---

# 📦 8️⃣ Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

- 🔹 React.lazy
- 🔹 Suspense
- 🔹 Lazy Loading
- 🔹 Improving performance
